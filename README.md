# BrightnessChanger

Windows-only program for changing screen brightness above or below the default limits by adjusting gamma. For a macOS version, see [SoftwareGammaBrightness](https://github.com/sbond75/SoftwareGammaBrightness).

## Usage

Put a float value into `config.txt` next to the executable. If it is less than 1, the screen will dim; if greater than 1, the screen will brighten.
